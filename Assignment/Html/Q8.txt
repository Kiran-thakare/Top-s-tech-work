1.Inline CSS
CSS rules are applied directly to individual HTML elements using the style attribute.
This method is not scalable and should generally be avoided for large websites as it makes the HTML less readable and harder to maintain.
Example:

<h1 style="color: blue; font-size: 24px;">Hello World!</h1>

2. Internal (Embedded) CSS
CSS is placed inside a <style> tag within the <head> section of the HTML document.
This is useful for styling a single page but isn't ideal for multiple pages as it doesn't allow for code reuse across different pages.

<head>
    <style>
        h1 {
            color: blue;
            font-size: 24px;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
</body>

3. External CSS
CSS is written in a separate .css file and linked to the HTML document using a <link> tag in the <head>.
This method is the most efficient and scalable, allowing the same styles to be applied to multiple web pages by linking them to the same stylesheet.
ex:

<!-- HTML -->
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
</body>

h1 {
    color: blue;
    font-size: 24px;
}
