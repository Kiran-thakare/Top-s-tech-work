1 Web Page:
A web page is a fundamental building block of the web. It’s a structured document that can be displayed in a web browser (such as Firefox, Google Chrome, or Safari). When you visit a website, what you’re actually viewing are individual web pages.
Each web page is typically written in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language). HTML provides the structure and content of the page. It defines elements like headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more.


2.Website:
A website is a collection of related web pages grouped together under a common domain name (e.g., www.example.com). These pages are interconnected and share a common theme or purpose.
Think of a website as a cohesive unit—a place where you find information, services, or entertainment. It can be anything from a personal blog to a large e-commerce platform.
The combination of all the web pages hosted on the same domain constitutes a website1.

3. Web Server:
A web server is a computer (or a cluster of computers) that hosts websites on the Internet. It responds to requests from web browsers by serving the requested web pages.
When you access a website, your browser communicates with the web server hosting that site. The server sends back the necessary files (HTML, CSS, images, etc.) to display the web page in your browser.

4.HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):
HTML is the backbone of the web. It’s a markup language used to create the structure and content of web pages.
Developers use HTML tags (such as <p>, <h1>, <img>, etc.) to define elements like paragraphs, headings, images, and links. Browsers interpret these tags to display the page.
Here’s a simple example of HTML:
HTML

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Web Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Site</h1>
    <p>This is my first web page!</p>
  </body>
</html>

5.CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):
CSS complements HTML by controlling the visual presentation of web pages. It defines how elements should look—colors, fonts, spacing, layout, etc.
Developers write CSS rules to style specific HTML elements. These rules can be embedded within the HTML file or placed in separate CSS files.
Example of CSS:
CSS

h1 {
  color: #0074D9;
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}
p {
  font-size: 16px;
  line-height: 1.5;
}
